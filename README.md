# machine-learning-web-app

Based on Kaggle.com dataset provided for [Allstate's Claim Severity competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity).

## Stage 1) -Current Stage-
### Data analysis
Data analysis and data predictions will be done in a jupyter notebook.

## Stage 2) 
### Proof of Concept
Once an accurate trained model is created, a simple web app will be developed using python's Flask framework to process inputs to predict claims severity on new data and represent it on the UI.

## Stage 3) 
### Polished Web Application
This final step will be to explore and see if it is possible to integrate the model into a web app with one of my proficient languages/frameworks such as Java(SpringMVC/SpringBoot), Groovy(Grails), or Clojure(Compojure or Luminus); then turn it into a full fledged web app sample of what is possible with machine learning.
